Rhizome Philosophy Basics
war machine is a tool of the nomad through which capture can be avoided and smooth space preserved

nomadic system of growth and propagation

real time environment affects the gameplay

colour combinations to unlock required by webcam

ideas are multiple, interconnected and self-replicating

images of thoughts

rhizome has no beginning or end

connection and heterogeneity: any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other, and must be

multiplicity: only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity" that it ceases to have any relation to the One

asignifying rupture: a rhizome may be broken, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines

cartography and decalcomania: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model; it is a "map and not a tracing"
